This game is a university project developed by a team of five people. In this project, I was responsible for working on the game mechanics and testing them. The entire game was written using a large amount of C# code for all its mechanics. Due to the file size, the full game cannot be included here. The game is a 2D platformer where the player wakes up as an acolyte and must collect flames in order to ignite the Great Fire.

First, the player can move, jump, shoot two types of fireballs, fight enemies with a fixed amount of HP, and progress through levels. The game was completed with one large level, which takes between 10 to 20 minutes to complete. A simple dialogue system was also implemented. Additionally, the game features music and sound effects for collecting items.

There is a damage system in place: the enemies are mages who can also shoot fireballs at the player, which can be dodged. Enemies do not detect the player immediately; they only notice them when the player enters their field of vision.

There is also a healing system and an inventory. The player can collect items such as flames (needed for quest completion) and food that restores health. Two types of food were implemented: bread and soup. Soup restores 5 HP per second. Players can also collect coins, which were intended to be exchanged with a merchant, although the merchant system was likely not fully implemented.

To end a level, a player must get to the portal and thats how ends first level of a game called "Numen Tenebrarum".
